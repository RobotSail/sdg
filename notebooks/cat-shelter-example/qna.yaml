      Alley Cat Allies recommends that feral cat colonies have proper protection from inclement weather.
      Following are detailed instructions needed to build a feral cat shelter. These building plans are
      recommended for use throughout the United States. For extremely harsh, cold, and wet climates,
      insulation (as described) is advised. Other types of shelters, such as dog igloos, can be used in less
      harsh climates. Go to www.alleycat.org/BuildaShelter for additional shelter ideas.

      Things to consider before starting your project:
      These will help you determine what you need to buy and
      how much work will be involved, and also provide a few
      helpful hints.
      - How many cats do you need to house? This number
        determines how many shelters to build. Keep in mind that
        not all cats are likely to use the shelter, or at least not all at
        the same time. This shelter should probably house no more
        than five to seven cats at once. You can adjust this plan
        to make a larger shelter, or build more than one shelter
        as needed.

      - question: |
          What materials are needed to build a feral cat shelter?
        answer: |
          One 4-ft. x 1/2-in x 8-ft. sheet of exterior grade plywood
          or waferboard, one 4-ft. x 8-ft. sheet interior paneling or thin plywood,
          one package roofing shingles or enough to cover 8-sq. ft. roof,
          two 2-in. x 3-in. x 6-ft. untreated lumber,
          Linoleum or other floor tiles (to cover 6-sq. ft. floor),
          One quart exterior house paint, two medium hinges, fifty 2-in. flat head wood screws or grippers,
          Four to nine bricks for foundation, small roofing nails, fiberglass insulation.

      1. Cut wood. For easy assembly, cut all wood first, then
      assemble the shelter. Some pieces may need adjustment
      after cutting.
      2. Put side wall A in place on the left of the base and screw
      front wall and left side wall together using one 17-in. corner
      post.
      3. Position side wall B on the right and attach to front wall
      using other 17-in. corner post.
      4. Position back wall and attach to both side walls using two
      11-in. corner posts. Note: Corner posts should rest on
      top of the base, as should the front, back, and side walls.
      All posts should be inside of the front, back, and side walls.

      Note: You may also cover the interior underside of the roof
      with fiberglass or plastic foam insulation, but be sure to cover
      it with plastic or wood. Foam needs to be covered to hold it in
      place, and uncovered fiberglass will harm cats. You can insulate
      the shelter with strong plastic to keep out wind, rain, and cold.
      Leave a small opening for the cats to enter. A flap can be placed
      over the entrance for added protection.
